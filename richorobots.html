                A simple implementation of Alex Randolph's board game Ricochet Robots including solver.
                This game is witten in JAVA. Where I learned some of the major algorithms in Computer science, one of such is "Find and hunt" algorithum. Over this I built an AI that can give the solution of the puzzle.
                The most intresting part was to learn how to build the GUI and the "back-end" supporting it. All the updates were done periodically in 4 different Iteration. 
                This Project is hosted on Github, which leads me to learn the version control language, git.
                The whole design was created by me and all the code was led by me.
