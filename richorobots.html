            <h1>Ricochet Robots</h1>
            <p class="discription">
                A simple implementation of Alex Randolph's board game Ricochet Robots including solver.<br>
                This game is witten JAVA. Where I learned "back-tracking" and other alorithms. We also built a AI that can give the solution of the puzzle.<br>
                Over all it was an intresting project,because I learned many different things like using GUI in depth, intreacting and managing the code using version control language "GIT" and github.<br>
                This was a group project where I was the team leader and did the entire coding of game using my logics and ideas. <br>
